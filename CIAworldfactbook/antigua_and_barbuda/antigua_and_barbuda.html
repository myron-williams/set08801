		<h3>About</h3>
		
		<p> Covering an area of only 440 sq. km, the dual-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda 
			is positioned in the Caribbean's Lesser Antilles and acts as a natural border that 
			helps separate the Atlantic Ocean from the Caribbean Sea. Since Antigua and Barbuda 
			are both islands, they share no borders with other nations. That being said, the 
			closest nation is St Kitts and Nevis. Antigua and Barbuda is also nearby to the 
			British overseas territory of Montserrat, and the French overseas territory of Guadeloupe.
			Mountains and hills are hard to come by on both islands. </p>
			
		<p> The highest point, as marked on the map, by an upright yellow triangle, is Mount Obama 
			(formerly Boggy Peak), which is located in the hilly region of southwestern Antigua; 
			and is a remnant of a volcanic crater that rises to 405m. Codrington Bay, an enormous 
			naturally occurring harbor is the largest and most notable geographical feature of Barbuda. 
			The bay allows ships and other watercraft to penetrate deep into the island. As observed 
			on the map, both islands are relatively low-lying limestone formations; and are ringed by 
			reefs and sandbars, and indented by beaches, small lagoons, and natural harbors. </p>
			
		<p> There are no rivers of note and only a few streams are present, as rainfall amounts are 
			quite light. The lowest point is the Caribbean Sea (0m)Beaches are of course one of the stand-out 
			features on both islands. White sand and clear blue water make these two islands a popular 
			destination for tourists traveling from Europe and North America looking to escape harsh winters. 
			Antigua and Barbuda tend to have warm weather all year round with little rainfall aside from the 
			odd tropical storm. </p>

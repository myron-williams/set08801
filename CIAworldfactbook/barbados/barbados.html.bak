		<h3>About</h3>
		
	<p> Barbados, the easternmost island in the Caribbean Sea, is relatively flat and less mountainous, 
		in comparison to its more-mountainous island neighbours to the west. It has an area of 439 sq. km (169 sq mi).
		As observed on the physical map of Barbados above, the island is roughly triangular in shape. In the western 
		half, the land rises gently from coastal lowlands into the rolling hills. </p> 
		
	<p>	Beyond those hills in the central highland region stands the island’s highest point – Mount Hillaby, at an elevation on 1,120ft (340m) above sea 
		level (as marked on the map by a yellow upright triangle). In the eastern third of Barbados, the landscape rises 
		sharply into low hills that shadow the coastline. In the southern part of the island, the highlands decline 
		steeply to the St. George’s Valley, where the land rises to form Christ Church Ridge between the sea and the 
		valley. </p>
		
	<p>	Barbados is drained by a few small rivers and all rise in the hilly areas of the central and north. 
		Rainfall also irrigates Barbados through a series of small streams. Offshore, much of the country is circled 
		by coral reefs.</p>

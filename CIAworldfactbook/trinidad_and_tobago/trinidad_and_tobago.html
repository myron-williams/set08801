	<section>
		<p>
			Located just a few miles off the South American continent, Trinidad and Tobago are hilly 
			islands with a few mountains of note. Covering a total area of 5,131 sq.km (1,981 sq mi), 
			the island country of Trinidad and Tobago, consists of two major islands of Trinidad and 
			Tobago, along with many smaller islands. As observed on the physical map of the country 
			above, Trinidad – the larger of the two islands, is crisscrossed by mountain ranges; the 
			most dominant of these is the Northern Range.</p> 
			
		<p>	It is a rugged area of hills and peaks with 
			the country's highest point being Mount Aripo (El Cero del Aripo) at 940m (3,084ft) high 
			(marked by a yellow triangle on the map). The lower Central Range spreads across the central 
			area of the island, and in the far south, a scattered group of hills (The Southern Range & 
			Trinity Hills) border the southern coastl. Trinidad is drained by numerous short rivers 
			and streams, with the Rivers – Caripo (in the north) and Ortoire (in the south), being 
			the most significant. There are also many large swamp areas.</p>
			
		<p> As for Tobago, there is a Central Ridge running down it’s spine, with some elevations exceeding 600m (1,968ft). 
			The islands have numerous small rivers and streams, and it’s coastline is ringed by bays, 
			beaches and a narrow coastal plain that rises into the hills. Tobago has a number of small 
			islands running along it’s eastern coastline.</p>
